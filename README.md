# JumpyBrain — Focus better. Do more. Feel calm.

JumpyBrain is a productivity application built specifically for people with ADHD/ADD. It combines smart task management, focus tools, mindfulness exercises, and rule-based task ranking to help you stay on track — without overwhelming you. OpenAI is used to draft tasks from a brain dump, not to choose what you do next.

## What Is JumpyBrain?

JumpyBrain is your ADHD command centre — a web app (plus Chrome extension) that adapts to your current energy level and helps you figure out *what to do next*, without the decision paralysis that comes with ADHD.

It is not just another to-do list. JumpyBrain actively:

- Suggests the best task to work on based on your energy and priorities
- Blocks distracting thoughts with a Brain Dump feature
- Tracks your focus sessions and builds streaks
- Sends deadline reminders before you forget
- Connects with Gmail, Slack, and Google Calendar to surface what needs your attention

---

## How to Use (No-Code Guide)

> This section is for non-technical users who just want to understand what JumpyBrain does and how to get started using a deployed version.

### Step 1 — Sign up or Log in

Open the app URL in your browser. Click **Sign in with Google** or create an account with your email. JumpyBrain uses secure JWT authentication — your password is never stored in plain text.

### Step 2 — Set your energy level

On the left sidebar (or the bottom sheet on mobile), you will see an **Energy level** slider rated 1–5:

- 1 — Exhausted
- 2 — Low
- 3 — Okay
- 4 — Good
- 5 — Peak

Setting this helps JumpyBrain recommend tasks that match how you feel right now.

### Step 3 — Add your tasks

Go to the **Tasks** page. Add a task with a title, optional due date, estimate, dread, and importance. With your energy level set, the list is ordered by the same rules as What next.

### Step 4 — Let JumpyBrain pick what's next

On the **Today** page, **What next?** shows one task chosen by those rules. **Start Focus** records that you started it and opens the timer with that task linked. **Not now** records a skip and asks for another task.

### Step 5 — Use the Focus Timer

Go to **Focus Timer** and start a Pomodoro session for your chosen task. JumpyBrain logs your session time automatically.

### Step 6 — Set up Blocking Rules

Go to **Blocking Rules** (under the "More" menu). Add the sites and apps that distract you, and optionally whitelist specific sites that should always stay accessible. You can turn blocking on manually, or set a schedule (e.g. weekdays 9am–5pm) so it activates automatically. Blocking also turns on automatically whenever you start a focus session.

> Blocking a **site** is enforced by the Chrome extension on desktop. Blocking an **app** is enforced by the native Android/iOS app — installing the web app on your phone's home screen is not enough; see [Building the Mobile App](#building-the-mobile-app) below.

### Step 7 — Connect your tools (optional)

Go to **Connectors** and link Gmail, Slack, or Google Calendar. JumpyBrain will sync relevant items into your task list automatically every 30 minutes.

### Step 8 — Check your Progress

The **Progress** page shows bar and line charts of your weekly and monthly performance — tasks completed, focus minutes, and your current streak.

### Chrome Extension

Install the extension in Chrome and pin it to your toolbar. From any website you can:

- See your next recommended task, mark it started, skip it, or mark it done
- Quick-add a new task
- Start or stop a focus timer
- Do a Brain Dump (capture thoughts without leaving the page)
- Check blocking status, sync your blocklist, or snooze blocking for 5/15/30 minutes from the **Block** tab

### Mobile App (Android / iOS)

The native mobile app (built with Capacitor) adds app-level blocking on top of everything the web app already does. Once granted the required OS permissions (Usage Access + Accessibility on Android, Family Controls on iOS), starting a focus session or hitting your schedule window will send blocked apps straight back to your home screen. See [Building the Mobile App](#building-the-mobile-app) for setup.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** with React Router v7
- **TypeScript** — used alongside JS/JSX across config files (`vite.config.ts`, `capacitor.config.ts`) and the Zustand stores
- **Vite** — fast dev server and bundler
- **Tailwind CSS v3** — utility classes wired to CSS custom property design tokens
- **vite-plugin-pwa** — auto-generates `manifest.webmanifest`, service worker, and PWA icon entries; installable Progressive Web App support
- **Zustand** — lightweight state stores (focus, blocking, timer, theme, UI)
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** — server-state fetching and caching
- **Framer Motion** — animation primitives
- **Recharts** — weekly/monthly analytics charts
- **FullCalendar** (`@fullcalendar/react`, `daygrid`, `timegrid`, `interaction`) — the Calendar view
- **Howler** — audio playback for guided Mindfulness exercises
- **Firebase** — client SDK dependency (present in `package.json`, not currently imported under `src/`)
- **Socket.io client** — real-time task and session updates
- **Workbox CLI** — service worker tooling for the PWA build

### Backend
- **Node.js + Express 5**
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** — primary data store
- **Socket.io** — real-time bidirectional events
- **OpenAI API** — AI task recommendations and streaming chat
- **Google OAuth + Google Auth Library** — sign-in and calendar/gmail scopes
- **Nodemailer** — transactional email
- **Web Push** — browser push notifications
- **Helmet + express-rate-limit** — security hardening
- **node-cron** — scheduled jobs (deadline checks every 5 min, integration sync every 30 min)

### Chrome Extension
- **React + Vite** — same stack as frontend, compiled to a Chrome MV3 extension
- **chrome.declarativeNetRequest** — blocks/redirects distracting sites without a background page per-request cost

### Mobile (Capacitor)
- **Capacitor 6** — wraps the frontend web build into native Android and iOS app shells
- **Android (Kotlin)** — `UsageStatsManager` (foreground-app polling) + `AccessibilityService` (instant app-launch detection) to block apps
- **iOS (Swift)** — `FamilyControls` + `ManagedSettings` to shield apps and filter web content at the OS level

### Task ranking and the ML service
- **Live ranker** — `backend/ml/priorityModel.js`. What next, the task list (`GET /api/tasks?energyLevel=`), suggestions, and `POST /api/priority/prioritize` all use these rules: deadline, importance, dread, energy, time of day, and a keyword category.
- **Recommendation log** — `RecommendationEvent` records `shown`, `started`, `completed`, `skipped`, and `session_ended`, each with energy and a snapshot of the task. `backend/services/recommendationLog.js` writes them. `POST /api/recommendation-events` accepts `started` and `skipped` from the clients.
- **Training is paused** — `POST /api/priority/train` does not fit a model. A per-user forest waits until this log is the training source.
- **Python + FastAPI** (`ml-service/`) — `/recommend` returns the same heuristic. scikit-learn and NumPy remain in the file for the unused per-user trainer. The Node API does not call `ML_PRIORITY_URL` to order tasks.

### Infrastructure
- **Frontend** → Vercel
- **Backend** → Render
- **ML Service** → Render
- **Database** → MongoDB Atlas (free tier compatible)

## Getting Started (Developer Guide)

### Design System

JumpyBrain uses the **JB Momentum** brand identity. Design tokens live in
`frontend/src/styles.css` as CSS custom properties. Key palette:

| Token | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#0f1020` | `#f4f4fe` |
| `--surface` | `#1a1b2e` | `#ffffff` |
| `--indigo` | `#6366f1` | (same) |
| `--violet` | `#7c3aed` | (same) |
| `--cyan` | `#06b6d4` | (same) |

The reusable `<Logo>` component (`src/components/Logo.jsx`) renders the SVG
monogram in four variants: `icon`, `full`, `mono-light`, `mono-dark`.

PWA icons are pre-generated in `public/icons/`. If you modify the logo SVG,
regenerate them by running the Playwright script at
`scripts/generate-icons.mjs` (requires Chromium).

---

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or later
- **npm** v9 or later
- A **MongoDB Atlas** account (or a local MongoDB instance)
- A **Google Cloud** project with OAuth 2.0 credentials (for Google sign-in and integrations)
- An **OpenAI API key** (for AI recommendations)
- *(Optional, for mobile app blocking)* **Android Studio** — to build and run the Android app
- *(Optional, for mobile app blocking)* **Xcode** + an **Apple Developer account** with the Family Controls entitlement approved — to build and run the iOS app (see [Building the Mobile App](#building-the-mobile-app))

### Environment Variables

Copy the example file and fill in the values:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | Port the backend listens on (default `4000`) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` or `production` |
| `BACKEND_URL` | Public URL of this backend service (used for OAuth redirect URIs) |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Allowed frontend origin (your Vercel URL) |
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB Atlas connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret used to sign access tokens |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth client secret |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key |
| `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` | Slack app client ID |
| `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` | Slack app client secret |
| `ML_PRIORITY_URL` | Optional URL of the FastAPI service. Task order does not use it; ranking lives in `backend/ml/priorityModel.js` |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | VAPID public key for web push notifications |
| `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | VAPID private key for web push notifications |
| `VAPID_EMAIL` | `mailto:` address sent with VAPID requests |
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server hostname (e.g. `smtp.gmail.com`) |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP port (default `587`) |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP login / sender email address |
| `SMTP_PASS` | SMTP password or app-specific password |

**MongoDB URI** — the value in `.env.example` (`mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/bouncybrain`) is a placeholder, not a real host. Using it as-is fails with `querySrv ENOTFOUND _mongodb._tcp.cluster.mongodb.net` because that hostname doesn't exist in DNS. Get your real connection string from Atlas → Database → Connect → "Connect your application" — it will include an extra subdomain segment (e.g. `cluster0.ab12cde.mongodb.net`), and use that in `MONGODB_URI`.

**VAPID setup** — `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` are required for web push notifications; the backend throws on startup if they're missing. Generate a key pair with:

```bash
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

Then copy the printed `Public Key` / `Private Key` into `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` in `backend/.env` (and `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` in `frontend/.env.local` — see below).

**Frontend** — create a `.env.local` in the `frontend/` directory:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Full URL of the backend API (e.g. `https://your-backend.onrender.com`) |
| `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | Same value as `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` above |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Same value as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` above |
| `VITE_EXTENSION_ID` | *(Optional)* The Chrome extension's ID (shown on its card at `chrome://extensions`). When set, the web app pushes your login into the extension automatically on sign-in/sign-out — see [Syncing auth with the Chrome extension](#syncing-auth-with-the-chrome-extension). Leave unset and the extension just keeps its own separate Google sign-in. |

### Running the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev        # starts with --watch for hot reload
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:4000`. Health check: `GET /health`.

### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # starts Vite dev server
```

The app opens at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Loading the Chrome Extension

```bash
cd chrome-extension
npm install
npm run build      # outputs to dist/
```

Then in Chrome:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `chrome-extension/dist` folder

The extension icon appears in your toolbar.

The extension signs in with Google, same as the web app. Set `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (same value as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` above) before running `npm run build`, and add `https://<extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/` as an authorized redirect URI on that OAuth client in Google Cloud Console — the extension ID is shown on the `chrome://extensions` card after loading it unpacked once.

### Syncing auth with the Chrome extension

By default the web app and the extension are two independent logins — each does its own Google sign-in. Once you know the extension's ID (from `chrome://extensions`, after loading it unpacked at least once), you can make the web app push your session into the extension automatically so users only sign in once:

1. Set `VITE_EXTENSION_ID` (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)) to the extension's ID, and rebuild/restart the frontend.
2. In `chrome-extension/public/manifest.json`, replace the placeholder `"https://your-app.vercel.app/*"` under `"externally_connectable"` with your real deployed frontend origin(s) — this is the allowlist of sites permitted to message the extension, so it must be exact (no broad wildcards) and match wherever `VITE_API_URL`/the frontend is actually hosted. `http://localhost:5173/*` is already included for local dev. Rebuild the extension after changing it.

With both set: signing in on the web app pushes your token, API URL, and profile into the extension's storage (`chrome-extension/src/background/service-worker.js`'s `onMessageExternal` listener), and the extension immediately re-syncs your Focus Shield rules. Signing out clears the extension's session too. If `VITE_EXTENSION_ID` is left unset, this is a no-op and both logins stay fully independent — nothing else changes.

> Security note: `externally_connectable.matches` in the manifest is the actual security boundary — any origin listed there can send the extension a login session. Keep it scoped to domains you control.

### Building the Mobile App

The mobile app is the `frontend/` web app wrapped in native Android/iOS shells via [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com), with a native plugin (`AppBlocker`) that adds OS-level app blocking. The web app builds and runs fine without ever touching this — only do this if you need to test or ship app blocking on a phone.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install              # pulls in @capacitor/core, @capacitor/android, @capacitor/ios
npm run build             # builds the web app into dist/
```

**First-time native project setup** (skip if `frontend/android/` or `frontend/ios/` already has a full native project):

```bash
npx cap add android
npx cap add ios
```

**Android:**
1. Merge the permissions and service declarations from `frontend/android/MANIFEST_ADDITIONS.xml` into `frontend/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. `npx cap sync android` to copy the latest web build in.
3. `npx cap open android` to launch Android Studio, then Run.
4. On-device, grant **Usage Access** and enable the **Accessibility Service** for JumpyBrain when prompted (Settings deep-links are provided in-app).

**iOS:**
1. Follow `frontend/ios/SETUP_NOTES.md` — add the FamilyControls, ManagedSettings, and DeviceActivity frameworks, enable the **Family Controls** and **App Groups** capabilities in Xcode, and request the `com.apple.developer.family-controls` entitlement from Apple (this can take time to be approved — request it early).
2. `npx cap sync ios` to copy the latest web build in.
3. `npx cap open ios` to launch Xcode, then Run.
4. On first launch, the app will prompt for Family Controls authorization.

After any change to `frontend/src`, re-run `npm run build && npx cap sync` before testing on-device.

### Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

## Deployment

### Backend (Render)

1. Create a new Render Web Service and connect this repository.
2. Set the **Root Directory** to `backend`.
3. Set **Runtime** to Docker — Render will use the existing `backend/Dockerfile`.
4. Set all environment variables from `.env.example` in the Render Environment tab.
5. Set `MONGODB_URI` to your MongoDB Atlas connection string.

### ML Service (Render)

1. Create a second Render Web Service in the same Render project as the backend.
2. Set the **Root Directory** to `ml-service/` (or whichever directory contains the ML server).
3. Set **Runtime** to Docker or Node depending on the ML service setup.
4. `ML_PRIORITY_URL` does not drive task order. The backend ranks with `backend/ml/priorityModel.js`. Deploy this service only if you still want the FastAPI process available; `/recommend` returns the same rules, and per-user training stays paused.

### Frontend (Vercel)

1. Import the repository into Vercel.
2. Set the **Root Directory** to `frontend`.
3. Add the following environment variables in the Vercel project settings:
   - `VITE_API_URL` — your Render backend URL
   - `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` — same value as `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` on Render
   - `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` — same value as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` on Render
4. Vercel will build and deploy automatically on every push to `main`.

### Mobile Apps (Play Store / App Store)

1. **Android**: Build a signed AAB via Android Studio (Build > Generate Signed Bundle) or `./gradlew bundleRelease`. Because the app requests Usage Access and Accessibility permissions, Google Play requires you to complete a [Permissions Declaration Form](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9214102) explaining why — do this before submitting, or the review will be rejected.
2. **iOS**: Archive and upload via Xcode (Product > Archive) to App Store Connect. The `com.apple.developer.family-controls` entitlement must be approved by Apple *before* the build will pass App Review — request it well ahead of your submission date (see [Building the Mobile App](#building-the-mobile-app)).

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes and ensure `npm test` passes.
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of what you changed and why.
4. Keep color usage consistent with the design token system in `styles.css`. Add new colors as CSS custom properties; avoid hardcoded hex values in component files.

Please keep pull requests focused — one feature or fix per PR makes review much faster.

Changes under `frontend/android/` or `frontend/ios/` (Kotlin/Swift) aren't covered by `npm test` — build and run them in Android Studio / Xcode before opening a PR.
